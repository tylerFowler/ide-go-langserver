Atom Golang IDE
===============

An Atom IDE package for Go, powered by Sourcegraph's [go-langserver](https://github.com/sourcegraph/go-langserver).

## But why this one?
This package does not leverage (though recognizes the greatness of) the
[go-plus](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus) package. It purely uses
Sourcegraph's Go Langserver for it's functionality. It also integrates with
the latest features of the Atom IDE.

## Installation
This package requires the [atom-ide-ui](https://atom.io/packages/atom-ide-ui)
package to be installed to expose the functionality within Atom.

## Early Access
This package is still in the early stages of development, be sure to post
any bugs you (or feature requests) to the Github issues page.
